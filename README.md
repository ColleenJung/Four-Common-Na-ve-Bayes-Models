# Four-Common-Naive-Bayes-Models

This repository provides a comprehensive overview and implementation of four common Naive Bayes models: Categorical, Bernoulli, Gaussian, and Multinomial. It aims to demystify the theory behind Naive Bayes and its practical applications.

# What makes Naive Bayes a “Naive” algorithm?
Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the features we use to predict the target are independent and do not affect each other. While in real-life data, features depend on each other in determining the target, but this is ignored by the Naive Bayes classifier.
**Though the independence assumption is never correct in real-world data, but often works well in practice. so that it is called “Naive”.**
